# RemoteInformationStealer
Description: The above code would read the contents of the files in the home directory of the victim user and send it over to the attacker machine by establishing a TCP connection over port 5555.

On the attacker's end, we will be using netcat to setup a listener on port 5555 and receive the data sent by the stealer program.

# INSTRUCTIONS
